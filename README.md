# Marketing-Campaign-Analysis - Yuri Velkis

<h2>Project Goal</h2>

<p>The dataset used for this project is based on a classic dataset available on Kaggle, which is designed to help students improve their skills in data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning. The goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of the customer profile, their spending patterns on the platform, and the effectiveness of the company's marketing campaigns.

More specifically, the project aims to achieve the following objectives: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Analyzing the Marketing Campaign Data Set.</li>
  <li>Explore the data set to understand the company's customer profile and behavior.</li>
  <li>Do a customer segmentation with cluster algorithms.</li>
  <li>Extract meaningful insights and provide actionable recommendations for the company.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Technology & Libraries</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Pandas</li>
  <li>Matplotlip</li>
  <li>Seaborn</li>
  <li>Numpy</li>
  <li>Sklearn</li>

</ul>

<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
    
<p> The dataset doesn't need too much data cleaning, except some outliers that must to be treat.</p>
  
<h3> Numerical Features Box Plot</h3>

<p>
<b>Let's treat the outliers</b>

<li><b>Income</b>: Very high values. As we have a normal distribution, we will keep 3 standard deviations.</li>

<li><b>Year_birth</b>: Very low values. We will use 100 years as the maximum age.</li>

</p>

<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>

<h3>Let's take a look at our numerical features distributions</h3>

<h3>Let's zoom in our products distribution as some interisting insights can be taken from the above overview</h3>

<h3>Insights</h3>

These plots shows us interesting things:
<ul>
    <li>All of our products have a similar right-skewed distribution, which leads us to think that there is a long room for the company to increase sales in each product category.</li>
    <li>As the count of costumer who spend 50 or less is very close for each category, it can means thst this is a group of customers that are not spending to much and we need to investigate this to ensure that is a customer profile and try to come up something to increase their activities. </li>
    
</ul>
<p>
We will talk about this later...

Keep in mind that one of our goals is to improve the company's promotion acceptance rate and find room for revenue increase.

<b>Let's check if is there any correlation between the products category</b>
